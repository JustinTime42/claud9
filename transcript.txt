OpenClaw - The Magical AI Assistant
0:00
I have never seen a project blow up as
0:02
much as OpenClaw. It is the personal AI
0:04
assistant right now and people are
0:06
loving it because it feels like the
0:07
first agent that truly gets you. And
0:09
over time, it builds up a memory of what
0:12
you're working on and your preferences.
0:14
And it is a fully open-source tool. And
0:16
so this is the GitHub repository. They
0:19
exploded up to 185,000 stars. I have not
0:23
seen a repository on GitHub with this
0:26
many stars. even beats out N8N now,
0:28
which is just crazy to me. But it's no
0:31
secret that there are a lot of security
0:33
issues with OpenClaw, both because of
0:35
how much control we're giving to the
0:36
underlying agent and because of some
0:38
issues with the codebase itself. So that
0:41
plus wanting to build something more
0:42
custom to me has inspired me to
0:45
basically build my own version of
0:47
OpenClaw. That's what I want to talk to
0:48
you about today because it's easier than
0:51
you would think to take the ideas that
0:54
really make OpenClaw feel magical and
0:57
build it for yourself. I was able to
0:59
replicate everything that's powerful
1:01
about OpenClaw in just a couple of days.
1:03
Just took me a couple thousand lines of
1:05
Python code and markdown. And so I'll
1:08
talk about how I did it. You can do this
1:10
yourself pretty easily. And honestly, I
1:12
encourage you to do that. I think the
1:14
balance we should strike here is we
1:16
should learn from these powerful open-
1:18
source assistants that are out in the
1:20
wild, but build something ourself so we
1:22
truly understand and control the
1:24
solution and we can customize it to our
1:26
liking. Now, there are already some
1:28
open- source solutions that are a
1:30
lightweight and secure version of
1:31
OpenClaw like NanoClaw, but this just
1:34
didn't check all the boxes that I want
1:36
for my own personal assistant/secbrain.
1:39
That's why I'm building my own. Now, I
1:41
don't have a repo to share with you like
1:43
OpenClaw, but I would kind of defeat the
1:45
purpose of this video anyway. I'm trying
1:47
to make a point here that you should
1:48
build your own take inspiration from
1:50
these other tools like OpenClaw. That's
1:52
what I want to show you how to do right
1:54
now. Now, I have already shared some of
1:56
the skills that I have for my second
1:58
brain. So, there's a video I did on my
1:59
channel that I'll link to right here if
2:01
you want to check that out. I will be
2:03
sharing a lot more on my channel in the
2:05
coming months as I continue to build out
2:07
my assistant as well. So definitely stay
2:09
tuned for that. So anyway, I want to
The Major Security Risks
2:11
really quickly cover some of the
2:12
security issues with OpenClaw. Then
2:14
we'll get into what are the beautiful
2:16
parts of the tool. How can we take it
2:18
for ourselves to build our own second
2:20
brain? And so there are two primary
2:22
lanes of security issues with OpenClaw.
2:25
I'm going to focus first on some of the
2:27
architecture issues with the codebase.
2:29
Recently, there was a one-click remote
2:31
code execution vulnerability that allows
2:34
attackers to steal all of your data and
2:36
keys from your OpenClaw instance. All
2:39
they have to do is get you to click on a
2:41
single malicious link, which it's pretty
2:43
easy to get a lot of different people to
2:44
click on malicious links. And then once
2:46
they do that, then it's going to send an
2:49
O token. Their OpenClaw will send an O
2:51
token back to the attacker. They can use
2:54
that to log into the victim's openclaw.
2:56
And because all the credentials are just
2:57
stored in plain text, they will now have
2:59
access to all of the API keys and tokens
3:01
for your platform adapters and other
3:03
things that you've given your personal
3:05
assistant access to. And then we also
3:07
have the issue with Claw Hub. This is a
3:10
marketplace that is publicly available
3:12
where people are publishing skills that
3:14
promise to extend the capabilities of
3:16
OpenClaw. But research found that there
3:18
are hundreds of malicious packages. And
3:21
so it's this beautiful concept that
3:22
people can share these ways to make open
3:25
cloud more powerful, but in reality it
3:27
falls apart because there are a ton out
3:28
there where really they're just stealing
3:30
your API keys, wallet private keys, SSH
3:33
credentials, the list goes on because
3:35
again everything is just stored in plain
3:37
text where you are hosting OpenClaw. And
3:40
also I've been doing a lot of research.
3:42
So, I'll have links to all this in the
3:43
description, by the way. But there was a
3:44
researcher where it took him fewer than
3:46
2 hours to hijack an OpenClaw instance,
3:50
get access to everything inside. Now,
3:53
the one thing that I will say is that
3:55
the creator of OpenClaw, Peter, he
3:57
really is doing a good job keeping up
3:59
with the security issues, adding new
4:02
features to OpenClaw. And so, I do have
4:04
hope that there is a good future for the
4:06
tool. But even if you address all of
4:09
these architecture problems like I'm
4:11
speaking to, I do think that OpenClaw
4:13
will still be a security nightmare as
4:16
Cisco puts it and that's because of that
4:18
second lane of security problems that I
4:20
am talking about. There is this massive
4:23
code base. Open Claw is pretty big. We
4:25
don't understand it and we're just
4:26
running it and trusting it. But it's
4:28
giving so much power to our agents and
4:30
that I think is just so dangerous. Most
4:33
people are not ready for their agent to
4:35
wield all the power that OpenClaw gives
4:38
it. So that's why I'm a proponent of
4:39
building your own solution because then
4:41
you truly understand and control what
4:43
your agent is doing and you can
4:45
customize it to the exact level of
4:47
control that you need for your agent.
4:50
And so don't get me wrong, like Cisco
4:52
says here, from a capability
4:53
perspective, OpenClaw is groundbreaking.
4:55
That's why I want to use it as a
4:57
reference point for building the memory
4:59
system and the proactive part of the
5:00
agent. It's everything that personal AI
5:03
assistant developers have wanted to
5:04
achieve for literally years at this
5:06
point, but it's just way too risky for
5:09
me. And so that's why I want to take the
5:11
good components from it and just use it
5:13
as a resource. So that's what I want to
5:15
cover with you right now. There are four
4 Core Components of OpenClaw
5:17
components that make OpenClaw feel so
5:20
magical and these are the things that
5:21
I've replicated for myself. And I want
5:23
to stay pretty high level here because I
5:25
encourage you to go through this process
5:28
yourself. And it is so so easy. And so
5:31
within OpenCloud, we have the memory
5:33
system, the heartbeat, that's the
5:35
proactive nature of the agent, we have
5:37
the channel adapters, and the skills
5:39
registry. These are the four core
5:41
components that work so incredibly well.
5:44
And the best part about the memory
5:46
system is it's elegant, but also
5:48
extremely simple. The entire thing is
5:50
markdown driven. We have the soul.md
5:53
where the agent evolves its identity
5:54
over time. It kind of evolves the
5:57
identity of you and the user MD. The
5:59
core memories are stored and maintained
6:01
in the memory.mmd. We can also define
6:04
the agents behavior and in agents.mmd.
6:06
This is kind of like the global rules
6:08
for your coding agents. And then we're
6:10
keeping track of session logs every
6:12
single day. And for better search over
6:15
all of this, there's also a SQLite
6:17
database with a very light
6:18
implementation of rag built in as well.
6:21
So again, super elegant but super
6:23
simple. And then we have our heartbeat.
6:26
So we're leveraging this heartbeat.md.
6:28
This is a markdown document that tells
6:31
OpenClaw whenever it runs autonomously
6:34
on a scheduled basis, it should look
6:36
there to see what can I do for Cole
6:38
right now that he would appreciate. So,
6:40
it does things for us without having to
6:43
ask for it explicitly. And this is not a
6:46
new concept. There are a lot of agents
6:47
that have implemented this in the past,
6:49
but OpenClaw for the first time feels
6:51
like this agent that can do things for
6:53
us that we truly appreciate. It's not
6:55
just wasted work. And so you'll wake up
6:58
in the morning and OpenClaw will give
6:59
you this report like, "Okay, I drafted
7:02
this email and I created this pull
7:03
request in your GitHub repository." And
7:06
time and time again, people are like,
7:07
"Oh, wow. That's like really good. It
7:09
legitimately did things that I would
7:11
want it to do." And then next we have
7:13
the channel adapters. This is what
7:14
allows us to talk to OpenClaw in any
7:17
platform that we want. WhatsApp,
7:18
Telegram, Slack, Discord. The beauty of
7:21
this is pretty much anything that we'd
7:23
want to use is available out of the box.
7:26
And we support threads with a lot of
7:28
these platforms. And so we can have
7:29
multiple conversations going with our
7:31
OpenCloud instance at the exact same
7:33
time. And then last but not least, we
7:35
have the skills registry. So I know
7:37
there are the security issues with it
7:38
that I covered earlier. But the beauty
7:41
of this is even with just a single file,
7:43
we can add a new capability to open claw
7:46
like here's how I want to build
7:47
frontends, a guide for that. Here's how
7:49
it can help me generate powerpoints. And
7:51
then we can use that for ourselves very
7:53
easily, but then also share it with
7:55
other people. And so all of this
7:57
together is what gives us this magical
7:59
experience of feeling like we finally
8:01
have an ultra personalized AI agent. It
8:04
is able to remember our decisions,
8:05
preferences, and context. It can check
8:07
our services, do things for us before we
8:10
even ask. We can talk to it from
8:11
anywhere, and we can add any capability
8:13
with a single file. So it can act on our
8:16
behalf, anticipate our needs, and it
8:18
knows us better every single day. And
8:20
that's what I wanted to build for
Replicating the Memory System
8:22
myself. And so I'll show you here how
8:24
each of these features I have built it
8:26
into my own second brain. Starting with
8:29
the memory system. And take a look at
8:31
this. The memory files that I have for
8:33
my system is very similar to what is
8:35
built into OpenClaw. And that is on
8:37
purpose because what I did is I clone
8:40
the repo locally. I took my coding agent
8:42
which is claude code. I pointed it there
8:44
and I said, "Look at how they built
8:45
their memory system and I want you to
8:47
build it for me adapted to my tech stack
8:50
for my second brain." And it thrived on
8:54
this example. Let me tell you, coding
8:55
agents work really well when you give
8:57
them good examples. So, if we're working
8:59
on top of something that is simple and
9:00
elegant and just works really well, that
9:03
is the ultimate brain food for the
9:05
context for the coding agent. And so, it
9:07
oneshotted this whole thing for me and
9:09
even adapted it to my codebase. It has
9:12
the same rag strategy with SQLite.
9:15
Markdown is the database. And I also
9:17
added Obsidian for syncing because
9:19
something that I want to make a video on
9:21
on my channel soon. And let me know in
9:23
the comments if you're interested in
9:24
this is I took my second brain, I
9:26
deployed it to a VPS, but I still want
9:28
to have quick local searching when I'm
9:30
using the Cloud Code CLI locally. And so
9:33
I'm syncing my memory system. All these
9:35
markdown documents, I'm storing it in
9:38
Obsidian. And so my tech stack is
9:40
Obsidian for storage, Markdown obviously
9:43
for the memory system, SQLite for the
9:45
database, and I'm using Postgress when I
9:47
deploy it remotely, and then I'm using
9:49
the Claude agent SDK for the proactive
9:52
part of the agent that I'll talk about
9:54
in a little bit. And so that's my way to
9:56
run Cloud Code from my Python scripts.
9:58
And then obviously Claude Code is my
10:00
primary driver. I want to use this
10:02
because then I can use my anthropic
10:04
subscription. So, I'm not paying
10:05
hundreds and thousands of dollars for
10:07
API credits, which if you didn't know,
10:10
people have been getting their anthropic
10:12
subscriptions banned when they're using
10:13
it with OpenCloud. It's against the
10:15
Anthropic terms of service. But if we're
10:17
using Cloud Code and the Claude Asian
10:19
SDK ourself directly and we're doing it
10:22
just in our own environment, then it's
10:25
totally allowed even if you deploy it to
10:26
a VPS. And so, it's very cost-effective
10:29
to build your own second brain as well.
The Heartbeat & Proactive Tasks
10:31
And then for the heartbeat, it follows a
10:33
very similar pattern. All right, Claude,
10:35
look at how the heartbeat was
10:36
implemented in OpenClaw. Let's build it
10:38
oursself with our own integrations. And
10:40
so I'm using the Claude agent SDK. It's
10:42
a scheduled job that runs every 30
10:44
minutes for me right now. And we send a
10:46
prompt into the Cloud Agent SDK. So I'm
10:48
using Cloud Code directly from my Python
10:51
script. And I'm telling it to look at my
10:53
memory, look at recent emails I've
10:55
gotten, things that are scheduled on my
10:57
calendar, my tasks in a sauna, and then
10:59
give me notifications for anything that
11:01
need my attention. And then something
11:03
I'm still working on is more of the
11:04
proactive piece where it will even build
11:06
things for me or draft emails on my
11:08
behalf. And so we can take this as far
11:10
as we want because we have all of Claude
11:13
code, but just wrapped up in a script
11:14
that we're invoking every 30 minutes. So
11:16
it makes it feel like the agent is
11:17
constantly alive thinking about how it
11:20
can do stuff for us. And then for my
Channel Adapters & Interfaces
11:23
adapters, I have a very simple version
11:25
of what OpenClaw has built. One of the
11:28
things that I don't like about OpenClaw
11:29
is it's really cool how many adapters we
11:32
have, but most of the time you're just
11:34
going to find one that works for you and
11:35
that's all you really need. And that's
11:37
what I found for myself. I really like
11:39
talking to my second brain in Slack.
11:40
I'll even show you. I have that pulled
11:42
up right now. I mean, it looks a little
11:44
silly cuz I got deleted messages and
11:46
things. I'm still working on testing my
11:47
whole second brain, but I can talk to it
11:49
in Slack from anywhere. It's super cool.
11:52
And that's really all I need. I don't
11:53
really need Discord and Telegram. I just
11:55
have the one platform that works for me.
11:56
So, I have this as my adapter and then
11:58
the terminal for when I'm using Cloud
12:00
Code on my desktop or laptop. That is
12:02
all I need for my adapters. But I still
12:04
did have it copy the architecture of
12:06
OpenClaw. So, it's really easy to just
12:08
with cloud code or whatever coding
12:10
agent, I can just oneshot another
12:11
adapter if I ever wanted to use
12:13
something like Discord or Microsoft
12:15
Teams. And then finally, for the skills
Building Secure Custom Skills
12:18
here, since I'm using the Cloud Agents
12:20
SDK and Cloud Code, they both have the
12:22
idea of skills just built right in. So
12:24
whenever I want to give more
12:26
instructions kind of like the skills
12:27
registry for how to do something for me
12:30
like uh generate the Excal diagram like
12:33
literally the one you're looking at
12:34
right here was built by my second brain
12:36
or ideate for content help me create
12:38
YouTube scripts I just need to create a
12:40
skill and so one of the skills I have in
12:42
my second brain is a skill on how to
12:43
create more skills and so it's very easy
12:45
for me to evolve the capabilities of my
12:48
second brain just by having a
12:50
conversation with it and yeah there's no
12:52
public registry here so I'm not able to
12:55
share my skills at least yet. I'm
12:57
working on that, but it's a lot more
12:59
secure because then I'm not downloading
13:00
potentially malicious skills. I'm just
13:02
building everything myself and it's
13:04
really easy to do so. And so I'm getting
13:06
the ultra personalized agent using
13:09
OpenClaw to build things very, very
13:11
quickly. And if there's ever an update
13:13
to OpenClaw where it adds this new thing
13:14
that's absolutely incredible, well then
13:16
I'm just going to pull the changes from
13:18
the repository, point my cloud code to
13:21
it again, and say, "Hey, they just added
13:22
this thing. Let's go ahead and build it
13:24
oursel. Now, of course, you don't have
13:26
to copy my exact tech stack, but it is
13:28
working really, really well for me, and
13:31
I do plan on putting out some more
13:32
content soon, covering more in detail
13:35
how I built this out and sharing some
13:37
resources for you. But just overall, you
Step-by-Step Build Process (Simple, High Level)
13:40
have to follow this super simple
13:41
process. So, just as a quick review, you
13:43
clone the OpenCloud repo locally and
13:45
it's MIT licensed. You can do anything
13:47
you want with the code. Then you point
13:49
your coding agent at it, say, "Hey,
13:50
explain how the memory system works."
13:52
now build that into my own system. You
13:54
can specify any customizations that you
13:56
want as well to make it even better than
13:58
OpenClaw for you specifically. And then
14:00
you just repeat that for every part of
14:02
the platform that you want for yourself.
14:04
It is that easy. I mean, it kind of
14:06
feels like I'm just saying something
14:08
really obvious here, but I really
14:09
haven't seen people do this and it just
14:12
works so well for me that I have to
14:14
share it with you because this is making
14:15
a real difference for me. I like
14:18
OpenClaw. I did some experimentation
14:20
hosting it for myself when it first came
14:22
out, but I'm really really getting a lot
14:24
out of what I'm building for myself and
14:26
I feel like it's just going to get
14:28
better and better for me over time. Not
14:30
because I'm engineering something better
14:32
than Peter with OpenClaw, but because I
14:35
know exactly what I want and I can build
14:36
for that and I think that will resonate
14:38
with you as well.
